Hi, I go by *Sekiun* on the internet. I'm a self-taught software engineer who is mainly interested in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. On the side, I like to write electronic music and create visual art. I'm currently focused on writing C2 frameworks, learning low-level malware creation, and teaching myself anti-analysis techniques.
